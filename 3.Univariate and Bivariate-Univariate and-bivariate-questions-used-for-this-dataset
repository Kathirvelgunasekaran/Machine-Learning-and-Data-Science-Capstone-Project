### Explanation:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Removed currency symbols and commas from the price columns and converted them into floats.
   - The number of ratings was also cleaned (commas removed) and converted into integers, filling missing values with `0`.
   - Ratings were converted to floats for consistency.

2. **Univariate Analysis**:
   - Visualized the distribution of ratings using a histogram.
   - Visualized the distribution of discount prices using a histogram.
   - Visualized the distribution of actual prices using a histogram.

3. **Bivariate Analysis**:
   - Created scatter plots to analyze the relationships between:
     - Number of ratings and the product's average rating.
     - Actual price and discount price.
     - Discount price and product ratings.
